# Test example

This is the current test code that's being used in development of the module.  This is a more practical application than the "[simple](../simple)"
example, and exercises more features including:
* Subnet ID search
* Opening a port on the cluster for external access
* Both one-per-instance and standard load-balanced task definition and execution
* Sumo Logic and Datadog integration

As always, check [CONFIG.md](../CONFIG.md) when adjusting parameters to suit.  And please don't use `ecs_instance_bound_tasks` unless you really know what
you're doing.
